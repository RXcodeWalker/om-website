    "excerpt": "Poor Decisions Lead To 1-1 Draw At Home In Winnable Game Against Man City...",
    "content": "Last season, Arsenal drew 2-2 with Manchester City after leading 2-1 before Trossard’s red card forced us to defend deep with ten men, only for John Stones to equalise in stoppage time. This time, the script flipped. Haaland opened the scoring again, but City protected their lead with an ultra-defensive 5-5-0 shape. Just when it seemed enough, Gabriel Martinelli struck late to level it. A poetic coincidence — yet from Arsenal’s perspective, it felt like two more points dropped.\n\n<strong>Team Selection Questions</strong>\n\nArteta’s lineup raised eyebrows immediately. Merino started as a number ten ahead of Nwaneri. Trossard was preferred over Eze. Against Manchester City, with title implications looming, the setup felt cautious rather than assertive. If Arsenal aim to win the Premier League, the approach must be proactive — aggressive in possession and ruthless in attack.\n\nInstead, the starting structure limited creativity. Merino, naturally more defensive, struggled to unlock space. Trossard lacked directness. The issue was not individual effort, but tactical intent.\n\n<strong>A Pattern Emerging</strong>\n\nThis mirrored the approach at Anfield weeks earlier, where conservative choices allowed Liverpool to dictate rhythm. Beginning high-stakes matches with a safety-first mindset often hands initiative to elite opponents. Arsenal’s recurring issue is converting control into goals. Playing not to lose only amplifies that weakness.\n\nArteta’s substitutions also invited scrutiny. Merino remained until halftime, Trossard until the 80th minute. The urgency to shift momentum felt delayed. While Martinelli’s equaliser showcased resilience, it masked a broader concern about tactical boldness.\n\n<strong>No More Excuses</strong>\n\nThis summer’s recruitment has strengthened the squad significantly. Defensive depth, midfield reinforcement, and attacking upgrades with Eze, Gyokeres, and Madueke provide genuine firepower. Arsenal now possess the tools required to compete at the highest level.\n\nWith that depth comes expectation.\n\nFor three consecutive seasons, Arsenal have been runners-up. The squad is no longer transitional — it is competitive and mature. This may be a defining campaign for Arteta. Big games require conviction, not hesitation.\n\n<strong>The Mentality Shift</strong>\n\nArteta has elevated Arsenal from mid-table instability to consistent title contention. That achievement deserves respect. But to take the final step, the team must approach decisive matches with controlled aggression rather than caution.\n\nIn my view, a more attacking setup — Nwaneri over Merino, Eze over Trossard — could have tilted the match. Arsenal’s squad is capable of dominating elite opposition. The question now is whether the tactical mindset will match that potential.\n\nThe pieces are in place.\n\nNow it is about belief, boldness, and execution.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"  },

    "excerpt": "Our number nine is here at last! ...",
    "content": "We’ve known it for over a month — and now it’s official. Gyokeres to Arsenal, HERE WE GO. After three seasons without a true successor to Aubameyang, Arsenal have finally signed a recognised, ruthless number nine. Having finished second in the Premier League three consecutive times, the message was clear: we needed a striker to push us over the line.\n\n<strong>Elite Numbers in Portugal</strong>\n\nThe 27-year-old Swedish international arrives after a staggering spell at Sporting CP, scoring 97 goals in 102 matches across two seasons and leading them to back-to-back league titles. His explosive pace, intelligent movement, physical dominance, and clinical finishing made him one of Europe’s most productive forwards. He even recorded a hat-trick against Manchester City — a statement performance that Arsenal fans hope he can replicate at the Emirates.\n\n<strong>The Missing Piece</strong>\n\nLast season exposed our biggest flaw. We dominated possession, created high-quality chances, but lacked a reliable finisher. Too many draws, too many narrow margins. Injuries to Jesus and inconsistent performances from Havertz only highlighted the void. Even Merino’s temporary shift into a false nine role couldn’t fully address the problem.\n\nThis signing represents intent.\n\n<strong>The Transfer Context</strong>\n\nArsenal paid £63 million — a figure that feels reasonable in today’s market. Alternative targets included Benjamin Sesko, Victor Osimhen, and Alexander Isak. Sesko offers long-term upside but required patience and complex negotiations. Osimhen and Isak are proven at the highest levels but would have cost well over £100 million, with limited indications of availability.\n\nGyokeres may not yet be Premier League-proven, but he arrives in peak physical condition and at the height of his confidence.\n\n<strong>The Pressure Factor</strong>\n\nThe expectations are immense. He joins a squad desperate for silverware and a fanbase craving that final leap. The Portuguese league differs in tempo and physical intensity, so adaptation will be crucial. Missing portions of preseason could slow integration, and Arsenal’s season opener at Old Trafford offers little easing-in period.\n\nEarly rhythm will matter.\n\n<strong>A New Chapter</strong>\n\nDespite the pressure, excitement outweighs doubt. Arsenal finally possess a striker built to convert the chances our system consistently produces. Whether he becomes the next iconic number nine or forges his own identity, this transfer signals ambition.\n\nIf Gyokeres settles quickly and delivers consistently, this could be the missing piece in a long-awaited title-winning puzzle.\n\nA new chapter begins.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"

    "excerpt": "Arsenal have made headlines again, this time by...",
    "content": "Arsenal have made headlines once again — this time with a bold £52 million move for Noni Madueke. The signing has sparked widespread debate. Is this Arteta and Berta identifying untapped potential, or an expensive gamble on inconsistency?\n\n<strong>Initial Reaction</strong>\n\nAs an Arsenal fan, I can confidently say the fanbase has been craving decisive transfer action after quiet windows last season. This summer, however, has been transformative. Kepa, Norgaard, Zubimendi, Madueke, Gyokeres, and Mosquera have all joined, with Eze still linked. On paper, this looks like one of the most ambitious windows in recent memory.\n\nStill, the Madueke fee raised eyebrows. At £52 million for a player expected primarily to rotate with Saka, the valuation felt steep. Some fans reacted emotionally, even crossing moral boundaries by vandalising murals and directing abuse toward the player’s family — behaviour that is completely unjustifiable.\n\n<strong>Breaking Down the Player</strong>\n\nMadueke, 23, joined Chelsea for £28.5 million in January 2023 and now leaves for nearly double that fee. He is known for pace, direct dribbling, and confidence in one-versus-one situations. Statistically, his dribble volume compares favourably with Saka, but he trails in chance creation metrics such as expected assists and big chances created.\n\nHis likely role is squad reinforcement — crucial given how injuries exposed our lack of depth last season. Providing rotation for Saka reduces overreliance and injury risk, while potentially introducing internal competition.\n\n<strong>The Price Question</strong>\n\nThe inflated price tag inevitably increases scrutiny. Madueke will carry pressure, as will the recruitment team. However, Arteta has a history of unpopular decisions that ultimately proved correct: prioritising Raya, phasing out Aubameyang, and reshaping the squad by moving on high-wage veterans.\n\nRaya’s distribution elevated our build-up structure and he secured consecutive Golden Glove awards. Squad discipline improved post-Aubameyang. Strategic turnover allowed young core players like Saka and Saliba to flourish.\n\nThe broader lesson is that internal strategic decisions often look different from the outside.\n\n<strong>Backing the Process</strong>\n\nArteta and Berta understand the squad’s tactical and psychological needs better than external observers. While doubts about value are valid, trust in the long-term project remains essential.\n\nWhether supporters approve or not, Madueke is now an Arsenal player. The club benefits most if he succeeds. Backing him is not blind optimism — it is alignment with the team’s interests.\n\nI remain cautiously supportive.\n\nI hope he proves me wrong in the best possible way.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"

    "content": "As an Arsenal fan, I never thought too much about Diogo Jota. He was simply part of the opposition -- dangerous, clinical, always seeming to score when you least wanted him to. I didn’t follow his journey closely or celebrate his milestones. But today, that changed.\n\n<strong>A Life Cut Short</strong>\n\nWaking up to the news that Diogo Jota, just 28 years old, had died in a car accident alongside his brother André stopped me in my tracks. Suddenly, he wasn’t just a rival forward. He was a husband who had recently married his childhood partner, a father of three young children, a man who had just celebrated major triumphs for club and country. A life full of momentum and promise, ended far too soon.\n\nReports stated that his vehicle suffered a tyre blowout near Spain, caught fire, and within moments everything was gone. Just days earlier he was celebrating one of the happiest periods of his life. Now the world reads tributes. It feels unreal.\n\n<strong>More Than a Rival</strong>\n\nLooking back, Jota accomplished far more than I had acknowledged. Sixty-five goals for Liverpool. Multiple Premier League titles. Key domestic contributions. Forty-nine caps for Portugal and two Nations League triumphs. Yet beyond the numbers was something deeper.\n\nAfter revisiting his performances, I saw the intensity in his movement, the sharp pressing, the energy in his celebrations. There was humility and hunger in how he played. It was clear he loved the game.\n\n<strong>Perspective Beyond Rivalry</strong>\n\nThis moment reminds us how easy it is to reduce people to shirts and rivalries. Football can make us tribal, but events like this strip it back to something human. Behind every opponent is a life, a family, a story still being written.\n\nToday, I am not reflecting on Diogo Jota the Liverpool forward. I am reflecting on Diogo Jota the person. A vibrant life taken too early, with so much still to give both on and off the pitch.\n\nRest in peace, Jota. The game feels quieter without you.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"

    "excerpt": "While yet another trophyless season has concluded...",
    "content": "The football season has concluded, and while the sting of another near-miss in the Premier League lingers, we must not overlook the promising signs that emerged from Arsenal's youth ranks.\n\n<strong>The Rise of Ethan Nwaneri</strong>\n\nAlthough Nwaneri made his debut at just 15, this season truly showcased his growth. His confidence in taking on defenders, driving forward, and curling efforts into the top corner became increasingly evident, especially when Saka suffered a hamstring injury and Nwaneri stepped in.\n\nI genuinely believe Arteta could have integrated him more consistently, not only as injury cover but as a legitimate rotational option. Greater exposure, even during periods when senior players were underperforming, might have accelerated his development and added a fresh dynamic to our attack. His composure, vision, and long-range shooting suggest we have only scratched the surface of his potential.\n\n<strong>Myles Lewis-Skelly's Breakthrough</strong>\n\nLewis-Skelly's development has been nothing short of phenomenal. Since his debut in the 2-2 draw against Manchester City, he has grown into a confident left-back despite being naturally a midfielder. His aggressive ball-carrying, ability to break lines, and composure under pressure stand out remarkably for someone with limited senior experience.\n\nHe brings forward thrust from deep positions, something our team often lacks. Of course, his youthful exuberance has occasionally led to overzealous tackles, including one legitimate red card and a few fortunate escapes. However, this is part of the natural learning curve for a young defender adapting to senior football. With experience, his decision-making will mature.\n\n<strong>The Strength of Hale End</strong>\n\nBeyond Nwaneri and Lewis-Skelly, the broader academy system continues to thrive. The emergence of young talents like 15-year-old Max Dowman, who is expected to feature in the first team next season, highlights the exceptional work being done at Hale End. His potential is exciting, and preseason could offer an early glimpse of what lies ahead.\n\n<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>\n\nThe progress of these young players reflects Arsenal's strong commitment to developing homegrown talent. They are not merely prospects; they are already contributing meaningfully at the highest level. While the immediate objective remains winning major honours, the rise of this new generation provides a powerful foundation for sustained long-term success.\n\nMore detailed season analysis pieces will follow soon.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"

Declan Rice scored two sensational free kicks, and I have been replaying them ever since -- especially the second one.\n\n<strong>Context Before the Explosion</strong>\n\nRecent performances had been underwhelming. January passed without reinforcements despite mounting injuries and shallow squad depth. Results felt flat. The return of Bukayo Saka offered hope, but Gabriel's season-ending hamstring injury quickly dampened optimism.\n\nFacing 15-time Champions League winners Real Madrid without Gabriel felt daunting. With Kiwior expected to face Bellingham, Vinicius Jr, and Mbappe, confidence was limited.\n\nI was wrong. And I am glad.\n\n<strong>Total Control</strong>\n\nArsenal registered 11 shots on target and controlled the match from start to finish. Real Madrid survived early pressure thanks to goal-line clearances and outstanding saves from Courtois.\n\n<strong>Declan Rice's Historic Night</strong>\n\nNear the hour mark, Rice ignored the set-piece instruction to chip the ball and instead curled a stunning effort from distance. It was pure artistry -- reminiscent of classic Brazilian technique blended with English precision.\n\nCritics questioned Madrid's wall setup, but the strike was unstoppable. Courtois, despite being their best player, had no chance.\n\nThen Rice did it again. An even more precise free kick into the top-right corner. Only a handful of players have scored two direct free kicks in a Champions League match over the past twenty-five years. This was historic.\n\n<strong>Merino's Evolution</strong>\n\nMerino added a third with a composed finish from the edge of the box. His transformation from defensive midfielder to effective false nine continues to impress. While a world-class striker remains a summer priority, he has delivered admirably in the interim.\n\nCamavinga was sent off late for dissent, compounding Madrid's frustration. Arteta tactically outclassed Ancelotti. Even Bellingham admitted Madrid were fortunate it was only three.\n\n<strong>Half-Time, Not Full-Time</strong>\n\nThis was a statement performance, but the tie is only halfway complete. Real Madrid remain dangerous, particularly at the Santiago Bernabeu. However, Arsenal's defensive record provides confidence.\n\nThe second leg awaits.\n\n--\n\nOm Jhamvar"

    "content": "A few days back, Arsenal drew 1-1 with Manchester United after beating PSV 7-1 in their biggest Champions League away victory in history. Many expected a dominant Arsenal win at Old Trafford. Strangely, I expected a draw.\n\nAfter this season's repeated false hope, I refused to overhype a six-goal win without context. There were three reasons for that PSV demolition: PSV were out of form; their manager made serious tactical errors by spreading the midfield wide, leaving space between the lines; and Arsenal capitalised clinically on those mistakes.\n\nFun fact: Arsenal's xG in that 7-1 win was only 1.96. Compare that to approximately 3.50 xG across two legs against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, where we failed to score. The difference? Clinical finishing.\n\nOdegaard controlled that PSV game brilliantly, and even if Lewis-Skelly had been sent off, Arsenal likely still would have won because PSV refused to use a low block.\n\n<strong>United's Low Block Problem</strong>\n\nManchester United did the opposite. They parked the bus. Arsenal, despite confidence from Eindhoven, lacked the attacking quality to break down a compact defence. Amorim's side were content to concede possession because Arsenal could not convert it into clear chances.\n\nBruno Fernandes scored a superb free-kick just before half-time. Rice equalised in the second half to salvage a point.\n\nIt was a familiar pattern: dominate possession, lack a clinical forward line, concede first, then scramble for a result.\n\n<strong>Defensive Concerns</strong>\n\nRaya reacted slowly to the free-kick but redeemed himself with crucial saves. United created significant chances late on, and without Raya's interventions Arsenal likely would have lost. The defence was largely stable but allowed too many dangerous moments. Against elite attackers like Vinicius, Jude, or Mbappe, such lapses could prove costly.\n\n<strong>Title Realities</strong>\n\nThe Premier League title was effectively gone weeks ago. Now it is only a matter of when Liverpool confirm it. Arsenal's only realistic silverware chance remains the Champions League.\n\nThe 2-2 draw with PSV in the return leg was largely uneventful, aside from Sterling's two goal involvements. Unfortunately, his suspension means he misses the first leg against Madrid.\n\n<strong>Looking Ahead to Real Madrid</strong>\n\nArsenal face reigning European champions Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. It will require a significant step-up in performance to progress. Interestingly, I slightly prefer facing Madrid over Atletico. Atletico's low block would suffocate our attack, whereas Madrid's more open style may allow Arsenal scoring opportunities. The real test will be our defence.\n\nThere are rumours about Saka potentially returning for the Madrid tie, but given how rusty Ben White looked upon return, I remain doubtful.\n\nNext up is a London derby against Chelsea at the Emirates.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

    "content": "To all my amazing football-loving readers,\n\nThe most predictable injury in the Premier League has finally happened.\n\nKai Havertz will miss the rest of the season due to a hamstring injury sustained during training in Dubai. Ironically, a warm-weather camp intended to boost fitness ended the season of our only senior centre-forward.\n\n<strong>Injury Crisis Deepens</strong>\n\nThis adds to Jesus's ACL injury suffered in the FA Cup defeat to Manchester United. Saka is out until at least April, potentially longer. Martinelli is sidelined for nearly a month. In total, four senior forwards are injured, three long-term.\n\nWe were already struggling for goals even when Havertz and Martinelli were fit. Now the likely forward line consists of Nwaneri, Trossard, and Merino as a makeshift striker. Sterling offers little impact, and depth is practically nonexistent.\n\n<strong>A Preventable Situation</strong>\n\nTo some extent, this is misfortune. But it was entirely foreseeable. Arsenal entered January needing at least one striker, arguably two, even before further injuries struck. Yet we made zero signings.\n\nThis came after humiliating exits from domestic competitions and dropped points in crucial matches. Despite clear warning signs, the board chose inaction.\n\n<strong>January Window Failure</strong>\n\nLoan options such as Kolo Muani, Asensio, and Rashford were available. Depth could have been strengthened without major financial strain. Even recalling loaned players like Fabio Vieira would have added cover. Instead, the club gambled on internal solutions.\n\nHavertz played virtually every match, pressing relentlessly as a false nine following a demanding summer tournament. An injury felt inevitable. Now, just after the window closed, it has arrived.\n\n<strong>Accountability</strong>\n\nArteta initially resisted external signings, preferring internal options, but later acknowledged the need for reinforcements. While he shares some responsibility, the greater blame lies with the board and management.\n\nThe lack of urgency suggests satisfaction with Champions League qualification rather than genuine ambition for major trophies.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nThis January window may ultimately define our season. The damage is done. The best we can hope for now is that Merino adapts successfully or that the club corrects course in the summer.\n\nIf similar mistakes persist, deeper structural changes may be necessary.\n\n--\n\nOJ"

This came after devastating news of Havertz's hamstring injury ruling him out for the rest of the season. It was a massive result, and though we didn't play brilliantly, super-sub Merino scored both goals to make the difference.\n\n<strong>Defense Should Have Been Better</strong>\n\nAs usual, we dominated possession and kept a clean sheet. However, our defence was not as solid as expected against a 19th-placed side that hadn't scored in their previous four home matches. Leicester created a few clear chances that could have changed the game. For a title-contending team facing relegation opposition, more control was needed.\n\n<strong>Odegaard Must Step Up</strong>\n\nDeclan Rice was our best midfielder and tried to compensate for Havertz's absence with forward runs. He wasn't effective as a makeshift striker but contributed well overall. Odegaard showed flashes of creativity but must now take responsibility in front of goal, especially without Saka. Partey looked fatigued and was rightly substituted for Jorginho.\n\n<strong>Merino Delivers</strong>\n\nNwaneri was electric, constantly troubling Leicester's defence. Trossard improved after shifting left, though he struggled initially as a striker. Sterling offered very little and was replaced by Merino, whose two goals prevented what felt like another frustrating draw.\n\n<strong>Can Merino Be the False Nine?</strong>\n\nThis was only one of the first times Merino has played as a striker, making his impact even more impressive. With only three fit forwards available and Sterling out of form, options are limited. Merino's physical presence at 6ft 2in and strong aerial ability could make him effective in that role, particularly from crosses.\n\nTrossard remains better suited to the left wing, and Nwaneri thrives on the right, where his creativity drives our attacks. Moving them centrally would reduce attacking balance. That leaves Merino as the most viable solution for now.\n\nHe displayed more confidence and clinical instinct than Havertz has shown recently, especially with his header and composed finish. While he has spent most of his career as a midfielder, this unconventional adjustment could prove beneficial.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nI'm not entirely convinced this is the long-term answer, but it may be enough to keep us competitive in the title race. Perhaps Merino could unexpectedly become the solution we lacked up front.\n\nThanks for reading. If you enjoyed the post, please leave a like and share your thoughts below.\n\n--\n\nOJ"

When I saw the 2-0 scoreline the next morning, I didn't even feel disappointed. I read a brief summary, accepted the defeat, and moved on.\n\nThat too, on the back of a massive 5-1 victory over Manchester City.\n\nThat's how accustomed I've become to these substandard performances this season. Just when it feels like we're \"back in it,\" something pulls us right back down.\n\n<strong>Tired Squad</strong>\n\nI had a feeling this would happen. Going to Newcastle away just days after an intense clash against Manchester City was always going to be difficult. The squad looks exhausted from relentless back-to-back fixtures. Our players aren't superhuman; fatigue was inevitable.\n\nThis season has exposed how shallow our squad depth truly is. We lost Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah, and Reiss Nelson in the summer for modest fees despite them being reliable bench options. Arguably, Nketiah offers similar — if not better — finishing instincts than Havertz has shown recently.\n\nTo make matters worse, we made zero signings in January despite obvious gaps in the squad. Manchester City added five players. Aston Villa strengthened wisely. Even Tottenham secured Mathys Tel on loan. Meanwhile, we stood still.\n\nThe Zubimendi signing is promising, but he arrives in the summer. We needed reinforcements immediately — a striker, a winger, perhaps another midfielder. Instead, we strengthened nothing. For a club of Arsenal's stature, that is simply not good enough.\n\nIn this match, we paid the price.\n\n<strong>Awful Average Performance</strong>\n\nNo one truly played well, aside from Nwaneri who made a few promising runs. Raya had his first genuinely poor outing in months, making a costly error that allowed Newcastle to double their lead. It was reminiscent of the shaky mistakes he made last season, notably against Tottenham when he nearly squandered a 3-0 lead.\n\nTo be fair, Raya has been much improved this season, justifying his selection over Ramsdale. His distribution and shot-stopping have largely been solid. This simply felt like an off day.\n\nThe entire defence struggled, particularly Saliba who failed to contain Isak. The midfield lacked urgency and creativity. The front line, once again, lacked sharpness and attacking hunger.\n\nNewcastle were superior and deserved their place in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. Credit to them. It will be interesting to see if they can overcome the reigning holders and secure their first major trophy since 1955.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nThis performance was disappointing across defence, midfield, and attack. Fatigue plays a role, but ultimately the responsibility falls on the board and management. The squad was not reinforced adequately in either the summer or winter transfer windows for the intensity of English football.\n\nStay tuned for my next report on our trip to Leicester City.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please leave a like and share your thoughts below.\n\n--\n\nOJ"

    "content": "WE BEAT MANCHESTER CITY 5-1! I cannot believe it! I don't think even the most optimistic Gunner would have predicted this, but what a game that was! That was an absolute demolition job as we beat the reigning Premier League champions by four goals at the Emirates. I'm so pumped, I don't know where to start! The atmosphere at the Emirates during this game was electric. It just goes to show how massive of a victory this was.\n\nAnd the entertainment... Gabriel screaming in Haaland's face, tugging his shorts and refusing to shake his hand. Then there were the 'Stay Humble Eh' banners displayed by the Arsenal fans, although the award of this week's 'Stay Humble Eh' moment surely goes to Myles Lewis Skelly and his cheeky Haaland celebration.\n\nWe started with a bang, capitalizing on Akanji's mistake as Rice's astute touch forward allowed Odegaard to open the scoring in just a minute and forty-five seconds. However, after getting the lead, we sat back and, in my opinion, gave Manchester City much more possession than they deserved. Gvardiol nearly scored from a corner, but luckily Haaland couldn't reach it in time.\n\nHavertz missed an opportunity to double our lead with an open goal as he fired wide. Granted, he redeemed himself later with a goal to complement his opening assist. We finished the first half one goal up.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides was palpable, especially given last season's tension after Haaland threw the ball at Gabriel during the 2-2 draw. However, nothing too dramatic happened in the first half... yet.\n\nSECOND HALF\n\nTen minutes after the restart, Haaland equalized with a header and it briefly felt like City were back. Arsenal had gone into defensive mode and paid for it. But just 105 seconds later, a miscued pass from Foden and a deflected strike from Partey off Stones restored our lead.\n\nThis time, we did not retreat. A fabulous goal from Skelly gave us breathing room, and from there it was all Arsenal. Havertz scored the fourth on a swift counterattack, and Nwaneri came off the bench to score a stunning fifth in stoppage time. It was the icing on the cake of what I believe was our best match of the season.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Myles Lewis Skelly was sensational with his dribbling, defending, and sublime curler, not to mention his composed celebration. The way he shut down Foden and Marmoush showed unbelievable maturity for an 18-year-old. He played like a seasoned full back and demonstrated remarkable confidence. To me, he deserved Player of the Match.\n\n2. Ethan Nwaneri was outstanding off the bench. The 17-year-old played with confidence and capped it off with a beautiful finesse finish. Another Hale End talent proving the academy's quality.\n\n3. Partey, Odegaard, and Rice dominated the midfield with progressive runs and control. The midfield battle was completely in our favor.\n\n4. The defense was rock-solid. Our center-halves kept Haaland quiet, Timber was solid on the right, and Raya was dependable in goal.\n\n5. Our tactical high press disrupted City repeatedly and led to crucial opportunities.\n\n6. After conceding, we responded with intensity and refused to slow down. We stayed relentless and finished the game properly.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n1. We were not clinical enough early on. We often score first and then slow the tempo instead of pushing for dominance. That nearly cost us in past matches.\n\n2. Havertz is not a natural striker. While he scored and assisted, he lacks the instinct of a true No. 9. We still need a proper striker if we want to win major trophies.\n\nAll in all, this was more than a win. It was the culmination of a three-year battle with City. We can finally say we are better than them this season. Now we must build on this momentum and push forward.\n\nThat's all for today. I know I wrote a lot, but defining victories like these deserves passion. Thanks for reading!\n\n-- Om Jhamvar",

    "excerpt": "Arsenal drew 2-2 to Villa after beating 2-0 up...",
    "content": "Yesterday, we drew 2-2 with Aston Villa at home, marking our 8th draw of the season after bottling a 2-0 lead just before the hour mark. With Darwin Nunez's stoppage-time brace securing Liverpool a 2-0 win against Brentford, Arsenal are once again 6 points behind Liverpool, who still have a game in hand.\n\nArsenal dominated the first half and took the lead as Martinelli converted a cross from Trossard that Martinez failed to clear in time. Ten minutes after the break, Havertz doubled the lead by tapping in another Trossard cross, scoring for the first time since 28th December against Ipswich Town.\n\nHowever, Villa struck twice in eight minutes on the break to level the game. Arsenal pushed late, with a Merino goal disallowed by VAR for a Havertz handball. Minutes later, Merino hit the post and Trossard saw his rebound saved. In the dying moments, Timber slipped Trossard through 1v1 with Martinez, but his shot went narrowly wide. The game ended as a frustrating 2-2 draw.\n\n<strong>Are Defensive Injuries to Blame?</strong>\n\nWe were cruising at 2-0 before conceding twice in eight minutes. The defence takes significant responsibility. Saliba suffered a hamstring injury which Arteta was \"very worried\" about, suggesting a potential absence. Timber replaced him alongside Gabriel and performed reasonably well.\n\nWith Ben White, Tomiyasu, and Calafiori unavailable, and Zinchenko and Kiwior unreliable at right back, Arteta kept Partey at right back. Unfortunately, Partey struggled defensively. He misthrew a ball that gifted Watkins a chance and later failed to track him for the equaliser. Timber or White would likely have handled it better.\n\nMyles Lewis-Skelly impressed again with maturity beyond his years. Against a strong Villa side featuring Morgan Rogers, he showed composure and discipline. Still, conceding twice after dominating remains unacceptable.\n\n<strong>Midfield Imbalance</strong>\n\nDeclan Rice controlled the midfield much like he did against Tottenham, driving forward and setting tempo. However, Odegaard and Merino failed to support him.\n\nOdegaard has not returned to his innovative best since his ankle injury, worsened by Saka's absence. His creative spark feels diminished. As captain, he must rediscover that attacking sharpness.\n\nMerino contributed little for most of the match. Though strong aerially, his touches are limited and his influence minimal. His late disallowed goal and shot off the post were promising, but overall he remains more suited to a bench role, especially once Zubimendi joins.\n\n<strong>Attacking Improvements</strong>\n\nTrossard stepped up significantly. He delivered two excellent assists and was dangerous throughout, though he missed the late winner. Hopefully, this signals a return to form.\n\nMartinelli showed improvement on the right flank and made intelligent runs, including the opener. A positive sign.\n\nHavertz scored but remained slow and ineffective overall. While the goal may boost confidence, we still need a true striker. Reports suggest RB Leipzig may accept a 70 million Euro bid for Benjamin Sesko, which could greatly strengthen our attack.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nWe bottled a 2-0 lead and dropped crucial points. Defensive instability following Saliba's injury hurt us. Rice performed strongly, Trossard improved, but Odegaard must step up and Havertz remains inconsistent. With Wolves away next, we desperately need stability and momentum.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, please like and share it.

    "content": "2-1 win at the Emirates for Arsenal.\n\nFinally, Arsenal have shortened the gap to Liverpool to 4 points and capitalized on an occasion where Liverpool dropped points, winning the North London derby 2-1 at home following Liverpool's 1-1 draw against Nottingham Forest. Liverpool still have a game in hand, but we have edged two points closer this week.\n\n<strong>Relentless Build-Up, Poor Finishing</strong>\n\nIt was yet another instance where we created various chances but seemed to overplay them all as we couldn't get the right shot. It felt like we were trying too hard to find the perfect finish, which led to too many touches in the final third. We should have finished Tottenham off from the start with at least a two-goal margin, especially considering our first goal was an own goal from a corner kick that arguably should have been a goal kick. If not for that, I can imagine Arsenal drawing against a fragile, injury-hit Spurs side, which would have been a massive disappointment.\n\nOur attack was more relentless and fluid than our weekend fixture against Manchester United, which is an improvement. Once again, we dominated possession and chances.\n\nAnd once again, we struggled to capitalize.\n\nTherefore...\n\n<strong>We Need a Striker</strong>\n\nHavertz didn't play well; his finishing was below par even though he worked hard and pressed effectively. Trossard stepped up with a magnificent finish, far sharper than many of our recent goals. That's how we should be converting our chances if we want to challenge Liverpool for the title.\n\n<strong>Rock-Solid Defence</strong>\n\nRaya made some key saves, particularly when he denied Kulusevski following a set piece. He also came out confidently to collect several high crosses before they could cause danger.\n\nTimber kept Son quiet, Saliba and Gabriel were solid, and Myles Lewis-Skelly was fantastic. The 18-year-old defended brilliantly and deservedly received a standing ovation from the home crowd when he was substituted for Zinchenko. Gabriel also caused problems from corners and took a strong header that deflected into the goal.\n\nIt was another excellent performance from the back five.\n\n<strong>Strong Midfield</strong>\n\nDeclan Rice delivered a remarkable performance. He started slowly but grew into the game, making powerful dribbles through the final third and controlling midfield with authority. Odegaard showed his usual elegance in movement and link-up play, though he still seems slightly below his peak level since Saka's hamstring injury. Partey gave the ball away a couple of times but still performed adequately overall.\n\n<strong>Lingering Attacking Issues</strong>\n\nTrossard scored well, but he was the only forward who truly impressed. Sterling was too passive and failed to make the most of his first Premier League start this season. He was replaced by Martinelli at the hour mark, but Martinelli is less effective on the right than on his natural left side. Nwaneri is expected to return later this month and has been the most capable option in Saka's absence, so his return could be crucial. Havertz worked tirelessly but once again lacked clinical finishing.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nAll in all, it was another trademark Arsenal performance: fantastic defence, strong midfield control, promising build-up play, but poor finishing. On the bright side, we won a London derby and gained two crucial points on Liverpool.\n\nNext up is our weekend fixture at home against Aston Villa. Let me know your thoughts on Arsenal's performance against Tottenham or how you think we will fare against Villa.

    "category": "Football",
    "date": "Jan 17, 2025",
    "excerpt": "Arsenal make crucial summer signing Zubimendi...",
    "content" : "Arsenal have signed Spanish CDM Martin Zubimendi for 51 million pounds. Zubimendi, aged 25, is set to join Arsenal from Real Sociedad over the summer. Unfortunately, this means that we won't have him in our team until next season. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic signing on the face of it.\n\n<strong>Midfield Transition</strong>\n\nThomas Partey and Jorginho, both of whom are over 30 years old, seem set to leave Arsenal once their contracts expire at the end of the season. Jorginho was never worth a lot but Partey was signed for 45 million pounds and has since been a pivotal central midfielder for us. However, Zubimendi has the advantage in his youth, agility, and defensive capabilities, which are only expected to improve as he shifts from a 7th-place La Liga side to a dominant team like Arsenal, who are challenging for the Premier League title.\n\nThis is a testament to the progress that Arteta has made ever since joining Arsenal, despite the growing number of disgruntled fans leading the ArtetaOut movement. Many people have been demanding why Arsenal are investing in a CDM rather than a striker, who they well and truly require.\n\n<strong>Why This Signing Makes Sense</strong>\n\nHowever, getting Zubimendi will complement Odegaard and Rice to add more quality to the midfield, and it will only strengthen our squad next season. As mentioned, Zubimendi is arguably an upgrade on both Jorginho and Partey at this stage, and signing him enhances the depth and longevity of our squad.\n\nThis showcases our long-term mentality and how we are continuously improving our team. After Arsenal lost to Manchester United, we seemed to be falling apart. The club should have signed a striker after the summer transfer window last season, but they didn't.\n\n<strong>Transfer Window Criticism</strong>\n\nArteta takes a fair share of the blame for this, which he deserves. His stubbornness does annoy me at times, especially his optimism surrounding Havertz and Jesus, both of whom have been below par -- not to mention that Jesus will be out for another 6-12 months as he recovers from an ACL injury.\n\nWith Nketiah and Nelson leaving Arsenal, and injuries to Saka, Nwaneri, and Jesus, we've effectively lost five forwards. The only reinforcement has been a declining Sterling who is yet to start in a Premier League game. Trossard, Martinelli, and Havertz have also underperformed, with Havertz by far the most inconsistent of the three.\n\nHowever, a lot of criticism unfairly gets directed at Arteta. Some claims, such as sacking him, are absolutely ridiculous given the progress we have made. Although he does not have extensive silverware -- just an FA Cup and a Community Shield in his tenure -- he has transformed us from a struggling mid-table team into a dominant, title-contending side that comfortably qualifies for the Champions League.\n\n<strong>Backing the Manager</strong>\n\nThat is why, although he should have done a better job in the summer transfer window and can be stubborn at times, Arteta is still a great manager who has executed a strong rebuild. In moments when the team is struggling -- such as now -- the club and fanbase must stay calm and avoid overreaction. Despite the absence of a Sporting Director following Edu Gaspar's departure last year, Arteta and the management have secured a high-quality player for next season.\n\nArteta has also mentioned that the club is actively searching the transfer market for further reinforcements. Rumours have emerged regarding a bid for Dusan Vlahovic and interest in both Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres. All this highlights how premature the ArtetaOut movement truly is -- we don't even have a clear alternative in mind.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nAll in all, it's a strong move from Arteta that defies the criticism surrounding him. Zubimendi will add quality and depth to our midfield, and it shows that the club has long-term plans in place despite current setbacks.\n\nCOYG,\n\nOm",

    "category": "Football",

    "excerpt": "Arsenal have just lost two straight home games...",
    "content": "Arsenal have just lost two consecutive games at home, to Newcastle and a ten-man Manchester United, effectively ending our 17-game unbeaten streak at the Emirates -- the longest-ever since Mikel Arteta took charge of our club in 2019. Admittedly, Saka and Ben White's injuries have hampered our attacking capabilities (although Jurrien Timber has been a solid replacement so far). Nwaneri seemed like a bright prospect but his muscle injury, which may take \"several weeks\" to recover, added fuel to the fire.\n\nHowever, our build-up play hasn't been as shabby as it truly seems. Against Newcastle, we had an xG of 3.12 to 1.24 and 23 shots, and against Manchester United, our xG was 3.34 to 0.25 with 26 shots. Nevertheless, we lost to Newcastle 2-0 and to Manchester United 1-1 on penalties. The reason: we were \"toothless\" in attack.\n\n<strong>Toothless in Attack</strong>\n\nWe couldn't get the ball in the back of the net and weren't clinical with our chances. No injury can justify scoring 0 goals with an xG greater than 3 at home. And against United, ten-man United, it was devastating to see our performance. We were dead, literally dead, up until Diogo Dalot's red card. Even after that, our only goal came from a deflection.\n\n49 shots. At home. In just 2 games. A combined xG of about 6.5.\n\nAnd we only scored one goal. A goal that wasn't from an attacker or a midfielder but from a center back. A goal that was going to the keeper but luckily deflected in.\n\nThis is unacceptable from a team that has been agonizingly close to clinching the Premier League title for the last two seasons. We are simply unable to score, and it's costing us silverware big time.\n\n<strong>The Finishing Problem</strong>\n\nBut this isn't because of Saka's injury or Nwaneri's. It's because we are poor at finishing.\n\nThe player I am most critical of currently is Havertz. He's been extremely poor over the last two weeks, especially considering the chances he's gotten. He's been gifted with absolute sitters that he just can't get into the back of the net. Martinelli and Trossard haven't been consistently performing either. They can do well coming off the bench, but I don't think that they deserve a position in our starting 11 at the moment.\n\nJesus started performing well last month, but his knee injury looked bad. Considering how he had to be taken off by a stretcher, I don't think he'll be back for quite some time. We have no suitable forwards at the moment -- not even on the bench.\n\nIn some fairness to Havertz -- and I've said this many times before -- he isn't an out-and-out striker. He's more of an attacking midfielder, and comfortable in that position too. That seems to explain why he routinely drops back to support our build-up play rather than making forward runs in the final third.\n\n<strong>Arteta's Responsibility</strong>\n\nUltimately, the blame comes down to Arteta. Don't get me wrong -- he's a great manager who, over the last few years, has taken us from a struggling mid-table team to a title race contender that comfortably makes it to the Champions League. And I'm no fan of this ridiculous 'ArtetaOut' movement.\n\nHowever, his stubbornness and the rather irrelevant excuses he uses to smokescreen his mistakes have irked me in recent times. On so many occasions this season, we have struggled because of our incompetence in front of goal. It has led to 7 draws in the Premier League, and in each one of them, save for the Manchester City draw, we squandered meaningful chances which could have easily amounted to a win -- and 2 extra points.\n\nRather than emulating and surpassing the creativity and free-flowing attack we demonstrated last season, he has turned us into set-piece giants, compromising our attacking capabilities in the process.\n\n<strong>The Transfer Mistake</strong>\n\nThe one and only brilliant solution: stop using a CAM as a striker, and sign a striker.\n\nA few years back, we didn't have any issues with strikers. We had talented players such as Lacazette and Aubameyang, the latter being our team's star at that time. Unfortunately, a fallout with Mikel Arteta over disciplinary issues saw Auba leave Arsenal for Barcelona in the January transfer window three seasons back.\n\nAt the end of the same season, Lacazette departed for Lyon on a free transfer. As a result, Arteta signed injury-prone Jesus, who played very well in the 22/23 season but spent a fair share of matches on the bench due to injuries. Later, Arteta signed Kai Havertz for 65 million Euros.\n\nDespite improvements in the later half of the 23/24 season, it was evident to pundits and Arsenal fans alike that we needed a true striker if we wanted to win the league. Havertz wasn't a bad player, but he couldn't fill the hole left by Auba and Laca.\n\nInstead of signing a striker, Arteta reinforced other areas -- a fourth left-back, a midfielder, and a right-wing loan. None of these transfers addressed our real issue: a lack of firepower up front.\n\nWe lost forwards. And we didn't replace them.\n\nHence, our squad depth is shallow up front.\n\n<strong>Season Defining Moment</strong>\n\nUltimately, we have paid the price for it. The injury to Saka has shown how vulnerable we are in attack. Trossard, Martinelli, and Jesus have not been performing well the entire season, and Havertz is being forced to play in a position he's clearly not suited for. Our only reliable attacker has been Saka, and his hamstring injury revealed just how fragile we are upfront. Nwaneri might be the brightest aspect of our season so far.\n\nReports have emerged about Arsenal bidding for Dusan Vlahovic and interest in Benjamin Sesko. Whatever happens, we NEED a striker if we want to compete for a trophy this season. The UCL is a lottery at best, we're out of the FA Cup, and we're barely hanging on in the Premier League and Carabao Cup.\n\nIf we don't get a striker...\n\nIt's season over.\n\nAll in all, this is why I believe Arsenal Football Club need a striker. As soon as possible.\n\nBecause at the moment, we're playing:\n\nwith an inconsistent left-wing\n\nwith a left-wing on the right wing\n\nmost importantly: without a striker.",

    "category": "Football",
    "date": "Jan 8, 2025",
    "excerpt": "It's the start of a new year, and Arsenal are facing many issues...",
    "content": "It’s the start of the new year, and there are many things for Arsenal fans to celebrate. We are statistically the team of the year in the Premier League, largely due to our defensive and offensive prowess that emerged from the start of this year. Apart from breaking our own statistical records, we have enhanced the depth of our team with players like Riccardo Calafiori, Raheem Sterling, Mikel Merino, and academy talents such as Myles Lewis Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri.\n\nHowever, we dropped points on a frustratingly high number of occasions – 8 times this season. Although some of these can be attributed to sending-offs – and we have since improved our discipline – we have drawn several games we should have won.\n\n<strong>Games We Dropped Unnecessary Points In</strong>\n\nWe should have beaten Fulham 2-1 but drew because Martinelli made a schoolboy error of not staying onside (our xG was above 2). We should have easily beaten 15th-place Everton at home, but we succumbed to a goalless draw despite our “dominance”, as Arteta puts it, and an xG above 1.\n\nAgainst Chelsea, we had countless fantastic chances whipped into the box in the final quarter, most notably a 2-on-1 with Trossard, Havertz, and the keeper in the dying seconds of the game. Trossard should have left it for Havertz, who would have had the easiest of tap-ins to secure a significant London derby victory. But as things stand, the opportunity was wasted.\n\nFor all these games, we had Odegaard, Saka, Rice, Martinelli, Trossard, and Havertz, so they can’t be blamed on injuries. Instead, it was our inability to score goals from adequate chances that ultimately cost us the three points. In my opinion, scoring goals has been our biggest struggle this season – we can create some lovely chances, but we struggle at getting them in the back of the net.\n\n<strong>Attacking Struggles</strong>\n\nTwo weeks ago, for Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football special, Thierry Henry gave a thorough explanation regarding our struggles in attack. Most notably, he highlighted the lack of willingness to play forward and take risks as he addressed our “predictable” playing style of routinely passing the ball back.\n\nWhat he says is true, and the root cause of it might be Arteta’s defensive mindset that has largely remained the same over the last few seasons. In an attempt to “dominate” the game, we play too cautiously and take too few risks – especially after grabbing the lead. It seems like the players become complacent with a one or two goal advantage.\n\nHowever, as a title contender for the third time in a row, we must transform ourselves into a fearsome attacking side that frightens defences – like the team we were at the start of last year, scoring 4+ goals consistently for several games in a row.\n\nOne key hindrance was the Odegaard injury, which lasted about two months. His absence and gradual return were peppered with non-appearances from Rice, Havertz, Trossard, Merino, and Saka. This significantly slowed down our attack. To make matters worse, Saka recently underwent surgery and is expected to be out until March, amounting to two months of the football season without him.\n\nUnfortunately, even with our entire squad together and uninjured up front, we have struggled to score goals. Our draws against Chelsea, Fulham, and Everton highlighted the lack of attacking flow. One glaring aspect is the absence of a striker. It has become evident that Havertz is not a true No. 9 due to his slow movements and poor touches in the box. He has struggled to score goals, which puts pressure on other players to step up and do his job. When you get paid 275K a week, you just have to do a better job than that.\n\nIn fairness, Havertz seems to be playing out of position. He looks more comfortable dropping back a little to support the midfield. Perhaps he is better suited for a midfield role than the striker position.\n\nAnother key issue is our slow, passive build-up which allows the opposing team to regain their defensive composure, making it much harder for us to break through with clinical chances. In addition, we often try to maintain our defensive shape, dominating the pitch in the final third. However, this cautious gameplay leads to a lot of passing around the box, compromising our attacking prospects to nullify counterattacks and maintain possession. We don't make enough runs forward, and it hurts our goalscoring abilities.\n\nFurthermore, we have become too predictable on the right. 45% of our final third attacks linger on the right flank, more than any other team in the Premier League. This is largely due to Saka's dribbling skills and his silky link-up play with Odegaard, with Ben White often running down to complement the build-up. Unfortunately, both full-back and right-wing are injured, and Odegaard is underperforming at the moment.\n\nIn recent games, such as the one against Everton, the Toffees concentrated their defence on the right, making it hard for Saka and Odegaard to break through. Nevertheless, our build-up play has been neglected on the left, affecting our ability to counter from both sides of the pitch.\n\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\n\nAll in all, Arsenal need to revamp their attack.\n\nBefore it costs us the season. Again.",

    "title": "Year In Review: What's Wrong With Arsenal",
    "category": "Football",
    "date": "Dec 16, 2024",
    "excerpt": "This season, Arsenal have been rather poor...",
    "content": "With just a fortnight to 2025, 16 Premier League gameweeks have passed. In this timespan, Arsenal have a paltry 50% win rate, having drawn 6, lost 2 and won just 8. This unexpected and underwhelming first half of the season from Arsenal has astounded me. As things stand, they have 30 points and sit 3rd in the Premier League table, 6 points behind Liverpool who have a game in hand and 1 point behind Chelsea who also have a game in hand -- not to mention their extremely appealing run of fixtures for the next 8 games.\n\nIn addition, only 3 points behind Arsenal are four-time champions Manchester City, who will play a Manchester derby at home tonight. Therefore, in a worst-case scenario, Arsenal could end up 4 points behind Chelsea, 9 points behind Liverpool — both of whom currently have a higher GD than Arsenal — and level with Manchester City, who are not our main competitors but still worth mentioning.\n\nEver since Mikel Arteta joined midseason in 2019, following the departure of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery, it seemed as though Arsenal kept progressing and improving in some aspect or the other. The 19/20 season was shaky, but Arteta did join midseason and ultimately beat Chelsea 2-1 to win a record-extending 14th FA Cup.\n\nWhen the pandemic struck, Arsenal lost several key players and finished 8th for a second successive season, leading to a lot of criticism and doubt. The next season, however, Arsenal bounced back from an extremely poor start to finish 5th, just missing out on the Champions League. In 22/23, Arsenal defied all expectations to lead the Premier League, faltering in the last month but earning a steady 2nd place.\n\nThis was a major success for Arteta's project of rebuilding a new, young squad that could challenge for the title. After winning the Community Shield, Arsenal had an even more successful Premier League season, missing out on the title by the finest of margins and reaching the UCL quarter-finals for the first time in 14 years. It was another trophyless season, but to me, the promise of progression justified the silverware scarcity.\n\nTwice we had come second, only bested by the Manchester City juggernaut. Coming into the 24/25 season, I was only praying for a City downfall, which would surely guarantee an Arsenal title for the first time in 21 years... right? However, with the season almost halfway through, I'm not so convinced.\n\nArsenal have consistently been dropping points this season. It started against Brighton, Manchester City, and Bournemouth due to silly red card challenges, and was exacerbated by a ligament injury that forced team captain Odegaard onto the sidelines for months. His absence only highlighted his importance to the club, so his return, which coincided with other injuries clearing up as well, seemed like a fresh start for Arsenal. They won 3-0, 5-1, and 5-2 against Nottingham Forest, Sporting CP, and West Ham, scoring 13 goals in just a week.\n\nHowever, back-to-back draws in the Premier League since then have dampened my hopeful spirits of a 10 or 15-game winning streak that would bolster our title challenge as we play catchup with Liverpool. Instead, they dropped 4 points against Fulham and Everton, games we should have won, and have now given Chelsea a chance to outpace them as well.\n\nThese draws were unnecessary, and as title contenders, Arsenal should have won them without a second thought. In their 1-1 draw against Fulham, they had an xG above 2 while Fulham's was a trivial 0.16. Fast forward to the Emirates where, in a goalless draw against a team inches away from relegation, it was 1.22 vs 0.09. A stark difference that is not visible in the slightest on the scoresheet.\n\nThere are many factors to blame for this slip-up. On one hand, there were the disciplinary issues which have been improved upon and the key injuries that have largely cleared up now. Despite this, Arsenal have not yet returned to their dominant ways.\n\nIn my opinion, the team should take most of the blame for this. First and foremost, there is the glaring issue of our squad missing a key striker. Ever since Aubemeyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window due to a fallout with Arteta and poor discipline, Arsenal haven't found a suitable replacement.\n\nKai Havertz was supposed to fill in the gap but he has been a major disappointment. I like him quite a bit and he is rather hardworking. However, he isn't a true center forward and rarely has the impact required. What Arsenal genuinely need right now is a talented striker who can finish off chances and score goals. From what I've seen in these past few months, we have created brilliant chances, and the xG stats back me up here. However, our finishing has been below standard, and it has cost us crucial points.\n\nIn this case, you need a player like Erling Haaland, Alexander Isak, Chris Wood, or Ollie Watkins, who are quick in the penalty area and get the ball in the back of the net. After all, in football, it doesn't matter how fluid your build-up play is if you can't score. It's like doing well in a sprint race but stopping a few feet before the finish line.\n\nI'm not trying to be harsh, but Kai Havertz is slow in the penalty area and does not reliably finish off chances, which to me makes his high work rate irrelevant. He tries and tries, but the Premier League is a results industry, especially when you are a striker and your team is contending for the title.\n\nGabriel Jesus is even worse: he has yet to register a goal this season in all competitions, despite having countless chances to score a goal. He was good for Arsenal two seasons ago but has completely dropped off since then, and if you ask me, his time in Arsenal is done -- along with Oleksandr Zinchenko, with Calafiori and Myles Lewis-Skelly performing far better at left-back.\n\nMartinelli has also been performing poorly for the past few months and is struggling to create an impact in the game. His inefficiency at times causes Arsenal's build-up to shift to the right, with Saka and Odegaard, destabilizing it and making it harder to break through. This was seen in our goalless draw against Everton.\n\nAll in all, Arsenal's main issue is a lack of goal-finishing. That is why we need to re-vamp our forwards in the following January transfer window.",

    "excerpt": "How Contemporary Filmmakers Confront Social and Political Issues...",
    "content": "A study published in Social Science Quarterly found that movies with political messages can significantly influence viewers' opinions on social and political issues like healthcare reform, and these effects can last for weeks. This only begins to uncover the impact contemporary filmmakers can have in addressing societal challenges. In this essay, I will explore the cinematic techniques used by modern filmmakers to confront these issues. I will also examine how these techniques are used in different films.\n\nFilmmakers often use emotional appeal, or pathos, to draw viewers into characters' struggles and make complex social issues more relatable. Movies like “Black Panther” and “The Kite Runner” use this emotional connection to highlight the difficulties faced by underrepresented groups, such as African and Muslim communities.\n\nThe superhero movie “Black Panther” not only celebrates African heritage but also offers vital representation for African audiences. As Jamil Smith points out in the Times, such representation is scarce in mainstream media, making Black Panther a notable cultural achievement.\n\nSimilarly, “The Kite Runner” explores the prejudice faced by Muslim and Asian communities by focusing on the main character, Amir, who grapples with suspicion and bias in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks. Through Amir’s relationships and personal struggles, the film shows how these biases impact real lives.\n\nUltimately, by creating strong emotional connections between viewers and characters, films allow audiences to experience and empathize with the struggles of disadvantaged communities, making social issues like these feel immediate and personal.\n\nFilmmakers also use different narrative styles to address political or social issues differently. Firstly, documentaries use unfiltered footage to present the genuine views of marginalized communities. By avoiding sensationalism, they let ignored voices be heard in the media, encouraging important talks about justice.\n\nIn addition, many documentaries display important political events in engaging ways. In “The Big Short”, director Adam McKay uses humor, clear metaphors, varying tones, and fourth wall breaks to explain the 2008 monetary crisis, making complex financial ideas easier for viewers to comprehend.\n\nFurthermore, biopics like “The Iron Lady” use character-driven narratives to convey political issues. This technique allows viewers to connect with the characters and understand their feelings or underlying motivations, making the problems more relatable.\n\nWhen contemporary filmmakers address critical issues in their films, they incorporate several aspects in the storyline and dialogues. However, they also use subtle techniques like lighting, sound, and editing to reinforce the message they wish to create.\n\nIn general, harsh lighting creates discomfort and unease and typically depicts a grim reality whereas soft, natural lighting conveys hope. Silence is frequently used as a metaphor for voicelessness or suppression, making it especially effective in dystopian films like “The Hunger Games”. Moreover, fast-paced editing can create urgency around prominent issues and convey chaos and complexity. On the contrary, long takes and slow pacing can let the viewer dwell on the emotional weight of social problems, giving them time to reflect on it.\n\nIn conclusion, bonding viewers and characters while using an appropriate narrative style and tweaking certain technical aspects during filming are effective ways of presenting political and social topics, especially if the character represents a broader societal matter. In conclusion, movies are a powerful way to address social or political issues, and modern-day filmmakers have the potential to influence public opinion significantly.",

    "title": "Confirmation bias: We sure love ourselves!",
    "category": "Growth",
    "date": "Sep 7, 2024",
    "excerpt": "Confirmation bias is something that affects us all...",
    "content": "I have recently been reading a book called 'The Art of Thinking Clearly' by Rolf Dobelli. It explores cognitive biases, which are systematic deviations from rational thinking. They are tricks our brain plays on us while thinking to process information quickly. Unfortunately, they can result in us making errors in how we make decisions or what we think about the world around us.\n\nOne prominent example of this is the 'confirmation bias', in which we look for articles, videos, or other sources of information that support and reinforce our viewpoints and ideologies. For instance, if you are, say, a Ronaldo fan (like me!), you will more likely read about Ronaldo's struggles and achievements and why he is the best footballer ever, rather than focusing on Messi's awards and accomplishments.\n\nIn short, confirmation bias is when our brain filters out novel information that contrasts with our existing beliefs (also called 'disconfirming evidence') while keeping information that coincides with our beliefs ('confirming evidence').\n\nWe see this phenomenon in various locations. Take, for example, the business world, where a company implements a new strategy to improve it. Any signs suggesting that the strategy has been successful are embraced with wide-open arms, while opposite scenarios are labeled as 'exceptional' cases and ignored. In retrospect, this can cause a business to overlook certain aspects of its operations, significantly affecting its future performance.\n\nIn politics, political news is often biased towards one side or another, so when picking a particular viewpoint, people may only follow news sites that portray their preferred party as the 'good' side. This instance of confirmation bias can result in polarization and the citizens of one party simply refusing to listen to the other side, especially if they are part of a large political community with similar beliefs.\n\nIn the world of business journalism, a writer will construct a simple theory and find two or three pieces of 'evidence', like 'Apple is an excellent company because it fosters an innovative workplace'. The writer will go on to state several other companies that nurture innovation and how it has contributed to their success. It is important to note here that the writer might be correct in his predictions, but the point is that the writer is very unlikely to search for instances that disprove the writer's theory. This includes cases where companies achieved notoriety and publicity without harboring innovation or nurtured innovation but failed nonetheless. There must be various examples featuring both possibilities, but the writer chooses to ignore them since they would spoil the story.\n\nAstrology functions on similar principles: utterly vague horoscopes like 'Do not try to always be perfect' can be applied to hundreds of millions of lives worldwide, irrespective of their birthday. What's more, general statements such as 'Health is good' apply to practically every one of the eight billion human beings on this planet. This one in particular is dominant in the animal kingdom as well; in fact, it applies to every living organism. And yet it appears in the horoscope section of my newspaper at least thrice a week.\n\nEconomists too have been shown to conjure unclear assertions and predictions with no concrete base, predictions that could apply to a variety of scenarios, though they occur less frequently. Even self-help literature is guilty of this cognitive bias. You will often see commonly-repeated phrases like 'Meditation is the key to happiness' and 'Hard work is the key to success'. Personally, I enjoy meditating and although I do not do it often I find it highly calming. Nonetheless, these books do not talk about the many people who are happy despite not meditating or those who deal with depression and anxiety despite regularly practicing mindfulness, choosing instead to portray meditation as a gateway to utopia.\n\nIn short, most people relate better to ideas or notions they agree with or those that align with their core values. Avoiding confirmation bias helps you make more informed and objective decisions. When you're open to evidence that challenges your views, you develop a broader perspective and grow intellectually.\n\n--\n\nOm",
