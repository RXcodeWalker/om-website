    "content": "WE BEAT MANCHESTER CITY 5-1! I cannot believe it! I don't think even the most optimistic Gunner would have predicted this, but what a game that was! That was an absolute demolition job as we beat the reigning Premier League champions by four goals at the Emirates. I'm so pumped, I don't know where to start! The atmosphere at the Emirates during this game was electric. It just goes to show how massive of a victory this was.\n\nAnd the entertainment... Gabriel screaming in Haaland's face, tugging his shorts and refusing to shake his hand. Then there were the 'Stay Humble Eh' banners displayed by the Arsenal fans, although the award of this week's 'Stay Humble Eh' moment surely goes to Myles Lewis Skelly and his cheeky Haaland celebration.\n\nWe started with a bang, capitalizing on Akanji's mistake as Rice's astute touch forward allowed Odegaard to open the scoring in just a minute and forty-five seconds. However, after getting the lead, we sat back and, in my opinion, gave Manchester City much more possession than they deserved. Gvardiol nearly scored from a corner, but luckily Haaland couldn't reach it in time.\n\nHavertz missed an opportunity to double our lead with an open goal as he fired wide. Granted, he redeemed himself later with a goal to complement his opening assist. We finished the first half one goal up.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides was palpable, especially given last season's tension after Haaland threw the ball at Gabriel during the 2-2 draw. However, nothing too dramatic happened in the first half... yet.\n\nSECOND HALF\n\nTen minutes after the restart, Haaland equalized with a header and it briefly felt like City were back. Arsenal had gone into defensive mode and paid for it. But just 105 seconds later, a miscued pass from Foden and a deflected strike from Partey off Stones restored our lead.\n\nThis time, we did not retreat. A fabulous goal from Skelly gave us breathing room, and from there it was all Arsenal. Havertz scored the fourth on a swift counterattack, and Nwaneri came off the bench to score a stunning fifth in stoppage time. It was the icing on the cake of what I believe was our best match of the season.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Myles Lewis Skelly was sensational with his dribbling, defending, and sublime curler, not to mention his composed celebration. The way he shut down Foden and Marmoush showed unbelievable maturity for an 18-year-old. He played like a seasoned full back and demonstrated remarkable confidence. To me, he deserved Player of the Match.\n\n2. Ethan Nwaneri was outstanding off the bench. The 17-year-old played with confidence and capped it off with a beautiful finesse finish. Another Hale End talent proving the academy's quality.\n\n3. Partey, Odegaard, and Rice dominated the midfield with progressive runs and control. The midfield battle was completely in our favor.\n\n4. The defense was rock-solid. Our center-halves kept Haaland quiet, Timber was solid on the right, and Raya was dependable in goal.\n\n5. Our tactical high press disrupted City repeatedly and led to crucial opportunities.\n\n6. After conceding, we responded with intensity and refused to slow down. We stayed relentless and finished the game properly.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n1. We were not clinical enough early on. We often score first and then slow the tempo instead of pushing for dominance. That nearly cost us in past matches.\n\n2. Havertz is not a natural striker. While he scored and assisted, he lacks the instinct of a true No. 9. We still need a proper striker if we want to win major trophies.\n\nAll in all, this was more than a win. It was the culmination of a three-year battle with City. We can finally say we are better than them this season. Now we must build on this momentum and push forward.\n\nThat's all for today. I know I wrote a lot, but defining victories like these deserves passion. Thanks for reading!\n\n-- Om Jhamvar",
